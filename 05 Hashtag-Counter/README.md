# Instagram Hashtag Counter

## Overview
Hashtag Counter is a simple command line tool to check how many hashtags are left in a set. Instagram has a limit of 30 hashtags per post, however will return an "Unable to post" error if you go over without reporting how many you are over.

## Installation
Python 3 is required. 

Paste hashtags as a command line argument with quotes so that spaces are not treated as separate arguments.
